<p> In this experiment, you will be asked to select an image displaying a number of dots moving on the screen. Within this image, some of the dots will be moving in the same direction (either left or right).
 and others will be moving in a random direction. Your task is to identify the direction in which the majority of the dots are moving. This will vary from very easy, where many of the dots are moving
 in the same direction, to very difficult, where only a few dots are moving in the same direction, responding as quickly and accurately as you can.</p>
<p> There are two blocks consisting of 30 trials 6 seconds in length, 60 trials in total. In one block you will perform this by yourself, and in the other you will be paired with another participant. <br>
The experiment will take roughly 25 minutes to complete. </p>
<p> During the experiment you will encounter several instructions pages where you can take your time to read it, requiring your to press enter to continue. <br>
While we encourage you to take your time to read and understand these instructions, we also encourage you to consider the other person completing the experiment with you <br>
and respect their time.  </p>
<p> We appreciate your participation</p>

Initially, the trials will be 12 seconds with a 12 second break. Later it will switch to 6 second trials with a 6 second break, matching the experiment. <br>
Here, you will use the mouse to select a difficulty level by clicking on it, then responding with either "Z" for left or "X" for right when you think you know which direction the dots are moving. <br>
If you respond incorrectly, there will be a 500ms delay before you can respond again. <br>
Please try and complete each task as quickly and accurately as possible. <br>

<p> Congratulations! You have now completed the experiment, we appreciate your participation. </p>
<p> Your participation in this experiment is fascilitating an invesitgation into how people make decisions and schedule tasks 
both by themselves and in a team environment. We aim to investigate how and why people deviate from the "optimal" decision making process. 
For example, in the task you just completed, the optimal strategy to get the most reward for time invested was to complete each task from easiest to hardest.
Why do people deviate from this strategy, and how do they progress to this strategy (or something close to it) as the task continues? How is this process
different for those operating by themselves versus with a partner? These are the questions and processes we wish to investigate. <br>
If you would like more information or have any questions, please contact Luke Russell at: 
 LRussell1@uon.edu.au </p>
<p> Thank you for your time and participation. This connection will close in 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Please press enter to complete the experiment and return to either Prolific or SONA before this occurs</p>
